# Public Sector Case Management Data Modeling

## What Was Actually Done

A comprehensive data model was designed for public sector case management, supporting multi-agency public benefits and services portals. The model handles clients, vendors, staff, cases, notices, and transactions within a single Salesforce org.

### Core Entity Model

The data model includes:

- **Client Accounts/Contacts**: Representing individual citizens/clients (potentially person-style accounts)
- **Vendor (Provider) Accounts**: Organizations that provide services on behalf of the state
- **Vendor Contacts**: Staff working for provider organizations
- **Staff Contacts and Users**: Internal employees managing cases and services
- **Cases**: Primary records for ongoing service/benefits activity
- **Custom Notice Objects**: Mirroring notices generated by external systems
- **Custom Transaction Objects**: Mirroring transactions logged by external engines

### Case Management Model

Cases were customized to support:

- Intake from multiple channels (portal submissions, staff entry, integration-driven creation)
- Case creation tied to external IDs from legacy eligibility systems
- Status tracking and workflow management
- Assignment to queues and staff based on case type and criteria
- Linking cases to clients, vendors, notices, and transactions

### Notice and Transaction Objects

Custom objects were created to track external system outputs:

- **Notice Object**: Mirrors notices generated by external system, including:
  - Template codes
  - Purpose codes
  - Source codes
  - Delivery status
  - Linkage back to cases and persons
- **Transaction Object**: Mirrors transactions logged by external engine, including:
  - Transaction type
  - Status
  - Outcome
  - Linkage to cases and notices

### Identity and Linkage Fields

Carefully chosen fields link:

- External system IDs for correlation with legacy systems
- Portal user identities to Contacts and Cases
- Cases to notices and transactions
- Clients to vendors and staff relationships

### Record Type Strategy

Record Types were used to separate:

- Account Record Types: Client, Vendor, Internal Organization
- Contact Record Types: Citizen, Vendor Staff, Internal Staff
- Case Record Types: Different case types by service category

## Rules and Patterns

### Case Object Design

- Use Cases as the primary record for ongoing service/benefits activity
- Link Cases to Contacts (clients) and Accounts (organizations)
- Include external system IDs for correlation with legacy systems
- Support multiple case types through Record Types
- Track case status and workflow stages explicitly

### Notice Object Modeling

- Create custom Notice objects to track outbound communications from external systems
- Include fields for Source/Template/Purpose codes owned by external system
- Link notices to Cases and Contacts for reporting
- Track notice delivery status and outcomes
- Support notice history and audit trails

### Transaction Object Modeling

- Create custom Transaction objects to track transactions logged by external engines
- Include transaction type, status, and outcome fields
- Link transactions to Cases and Notices
- Support transaction history and reporting
- Track transaction timestamps and external system correlation IDs

### External System Integration Fields

Add fields to support external system integration:
- External system IDs for correlation
- Last sync timestamp fields
- Integration job tracking fields
- Source system identification fields
- Error tracking fields for failed integrations

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

- Use Record Types to distinguish between client, vendor, and internal records
- Implement Sharing Sets to enforce data visibility rules per user type
- Design role hierarchies that support cross-agency visibility for authorized staff
- Use field-level security to protect sensitive PII
- Portal users see only their own records; internal users see broader data sets

## Suggested Improvements (From AI)

### Enhanced Case Workflow Modeling

Consider more sophisticated case workflow modeling:
- Model case stages and transitions explicitly
- Support parallel case processes (multiple services per case)
- Track case milestones and deadlines
- Automate case routing and assignment based on rules
- Support case escalation and reassignment workflows

### Notice and Transaction Integration

Enhance notice and transaction integration:
- Automate notice generation triggers from case status changes
- Support notice templates and personalization
- Track notice delivery and read receipts
- Integrate transaction outcomes back into case status
- Support transaction reversal and correction processes

### Client-Vendor Relationship Modeling

Model client-vendor relationships more explicitly:
- Create relationship objects for client-vendor assignments
- Track service provider assignments and changes over time
- Support multiple vendors per client
- Track vendor performance metrics
- Model vendor capacity and availability

### Data Quality and Deduplication

Enhance data quality for public sector data:
- Implement deduplication for client records
- Validate client identity and eligibility data
- Handle data inconsistencies from legacy systems
- Create data quality reports for review
- Implement data cleansing processes

## To Validate

- Specific custom object structures (Notice, Transaction) and field definitions
- Case Record Type structure and status workflow
- External system ID field names and correlation logic
- Notice and transaction integration patterns
- Client-vendor relationship modeling approach
- Data quality tool configuration and matching rules
