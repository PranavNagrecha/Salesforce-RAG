# Delivery Approach

## What Was Actually Done

Sprint-based delivery was used to manage complex multi-stakeholder projects. The approach emphasized clear scope definition, stakeholder coordination, and iterative delivery of Salesforce configuration, integration work, and portal functionality.

### Sprint-Based Delivery

Sprint-based delivery was implemented with:

- Clear sprint definitions (Sprint 1, Sprint 2, etc.) with defined scope
- Tracking of Salesforce configuration work within each sprint
- Integration testing milestones aligned with sprint deliverables
- Portal functionality delivered incrementally across sprints
- Clear scope definition and tracking to avoid scope creep

### Stakeholder Coordination

Coordination was maintained across multiple stakeholder groups:

- State IT teams for infrastructure and security requirements
- Vendor integrators for integration platform work (MuleSoft, Boomi)
- Analyst partners for business analysis and requirements
- Internal teams for Salesforce configuration and development
- Keeping everyone aligned on sprint scope and deliverables

### Testing Window Coordination

Testing windows were coordinated across stakeholders:

- Reserved testing periods (e.g., December testing periods) for integration validation
- Coordination of testing schedules across multiple systems
- Alignment of testing milestones with sprint deliverables
- User acceptance testing (UAT) coordination with business stakeholders

### Change Management

Change management processes were established:

- Discussions about when/how new objects and automations need to be reflected in technical design docs (TDD)
- Keeping diagrams and documentation aligned with actual implemented flows
- Version control for design documents and technical specifications
- Communication of changes to all stakeholders

## Rules and Patterns

### Sprint Planning

- Define clear scope for each sprint with specific deliverables
- Track Salesforce configuration work, integration milestones, and portal functionality separately
- Align sprint deliverables with testing windows and stakeholder availability
- Communicate sprint scope clearly to all stakeholders
- Review and adjust sprint scope based on velocity and dependencies

### Stakeholder Management

- Maintain regular communication with all stakeholder groups
- Keep everyone aligned on sprint scope and deliverables
- Coordinate testing windows across multiple systems and teams
- Document decisions and open items from stakeholder meetings
- Escalate blockers and dependencies promptly

### Integration Milestone Tracking

- Track integration testing milestones separately from Salesforce configuration
- Coordinate integration testing with vendor integrators and external system teams
- Reserve testing windows for integration validation
- Document integration test results and issues
- Align integration milestones with sprint deliverables

### Documentation Alignment

- Keep technical design documents (TDD) aligned with actual implementation
- Update diagrams when flows change
- Version control design documents and technical specifications
- Communicate documentation changes to all stakeholders
- Review documentation regularly for accuracy

## Suggested Improvements (From AI)

### Agile Methodology Enhancement

Enhance agile delivery practices:
- Implement daily standups for better team coordination
- Use sprint retrospectives to improve delivery processes
- Implement backlog grooming and prioritization processes
- Use velocity tracking to improve sprint planning accuracy
- Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for faster delivery

### Stakeholder Communication

Improve stakeholder communication:
- Regular status reports with clear metrics and progress indicators
- Stakeholder dashboards showing project health and progress
- Automated notifications for key milestones and blockers
- Regular stakeholder meetings with clear agendas and action items
- Document all decisions and action items from meetings

### Risk Management

Implement risk management processes:
- Identify and track project risks proactively
- Develop mitigation plans for high-risk items
- Regular risk reviews and updates
- Escalation procedures for critical risks
- Contingency planning for integration dependencies

### Quality Assurance

Enhance quality assurance processes:
- Implement test-driven development (TDD) where appropriate
- Automated testing for regression prevention
- Code review processes for all changes
- Quality gates before production deployment
- Continuous monitoring of production quality metrics

## To Validate

- Specific sprint structure and duration
- Stakeholder coordination processes and communication frequency
- Testing window coordination procedures
- Change management process details
- Documentation version control and update procedures
