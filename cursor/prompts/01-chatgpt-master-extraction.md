# ChatGPT – Salesforce Master Extraction Prompt

You are my **Salesforce Work Archivist**.

Goal:  
Create a single, structured **knowledge dump** that captures my real Salesforce experience and patterns so I can save it as:

> `Knowledge/GPT Response.md`

and use it later as a RAG source in other tools (Cursor, custom RAG, etc.).

Assume:
- You have full access to everything you know from our past conversations and long-term context.
- This document should reflect **what I’ve actually done**, not generic Trailhead advice.

---

## 0. Hard Rules

1. **No hallucinated history**
   - Only describe projects, patterns, tools, and decisions that we have actually discussed.
   - If you’re not sure, put items in a `## To Validate` section instead of stating them as fact.

2. **Strong anonymization**
   - Do **not** include real:
     - company / client names  
     - government agencies  
     - universities / schools  
     - internal app or project names  
     - URLs / domains, ticket numbers, IDs, emails
   - Replace them with generic roles, for example:
     - “public sector benefits portal on Salesforce”
     - “public sector case management org in a compliant cloud”
     - “higher-education CRM integrated with a student information system (SIS)”
     - “community college implementation”
     - “external OIDC identity provider”
     - “internal SAML identity provider”
     - “ETL integration layer”
     - “event bus platform”

3. **Architect + developer perspective**
   - Capture **both**:
     - architecture (systems, interfaces, trust boundaries, tradeoffs)
     - implementation (Apex, Flow, LWC, Omni, Boomi/MuleSoft, data pipelines, testing, deployments).

4. **No AI meta-boilerplate**
   - Do **not** say “this was generated by ChatGPT / an AI model…”.  
   - This should read like a serious human-written technical article.

## 1. Document Structure

Produce a single Markdown document with the following structure and headings:

```md
# Salesforce Work – GPT Knowledge Dump (Latest)

## 1. Major Contexts

- Brief bullets summarizing the main types of work:
  - public sector benefits / case management
  - higher-education CRM + SIS
  - community college implementation
  - integration platform work (ETL, event bus, etc.)
- For each context:
  - what Salesforce clouds/features were used
  - what external system roles were involved (SIS, ERP, IdPs, ETL, event bus)
  - key categories of problems solved

## 2. Architecture Patterns

- Real architecture patterns that were actually used:
  - event-driven vs batch vs API-driven integrations
  - portal vs internal user separation
  - compliant-cloud considerations where relevant
  - multi-org / multi-system patterns (CRM ↔ SIS ↔ ERP, etc.)
- For each pattern:
  - when it was used
  - why it was chosen
  - tradeoffs and pitfalls

## 3. Integrations

- Concrete integration patterns implemented:
  - ETL-driven sync with SIS/ERP
  - middleware (Boomi, MuleSoft, etc.) patterns
  - platform events / event bus usage
  - near-real-time vs nightly batch decisions
- Include:
  - error handling / retry / idempotency approaches
  - logging / monitoring approaches
  - external ID strategies

## 4. Identity & SSO

- Identity models actually designed or implemented:
  - external OIDC login for portals
  - internal SAML SSO for staff
  - multi-tenant / hybrid identity patterns
- Capture:
  - high-level flows
  - trust boundaries
  - how user records are created/linked
  - key “gotchas” and lessons learned

## 5. Data Modeling

- Data models that were actually designed or heavily influenced:
  - student / program / enrollment / term structures
  - public sector case / transaction / notice structures
  - account/contact/role models for external vs internal users
  - external ID + key design for sync with SIS/ERP/other systems
- Focus on **conceptual entities and relationships**, not raw API names.

## 6. Security, Compliance, and Logging

- Patterns for:
  - permission set design
  - record access in portals vs internal users
  - compliant-cloud / regulatory constraints where relevant
  - logging / audit / monitoring patterns for integrations and flows

## 7. Project / Delivery Methods

- How work was actually delivered:
  - any FDD/TDD-style docs or patterns
  - environments and release flow
  - testing strategies (Apex tests, UAT patterns)
  - coordination with external partners in anonymized form

## 8. Development Patterns & Tools

- Reusable patterns used in practice:
  - Apex/Flow/LWC/Omni patterns
  - error handling conventions
  - integration utilities
  - data migration playbooks
- Any Boomi/MuleSoft / event-bus implementation habits worth recording.

## 9. Troubleshooting & “War Stories”

- Real debugging workflows:
  - how integration mismatches are tracked down
  - how data is reconciled between systems
  - typical production issues and how they were solved

## 10. To Validate

- Anything not 100% certain:
  - bullets with a short note like “uncertain date range”, “may mix two projects”, etc.
```
