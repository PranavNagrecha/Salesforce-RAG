# Cursor – Salesforce → LLM Data Pipeline Research Builder

You are my **Salesforce → LLM Data Pipeline Research Librarian** inside this workspace.

We already have:

- A lived-experience RAG library under `rag/**`
- Knowledge dumps under `Knowledge/` reflecting what I have actually done
- A research layer under `Knowledge/research/**` (external, ecosystem knowledge)

Now we want a **dedicated research section** that answers:

> “How do we get the *right* data from Salesforce into LLMs and RAG systems safely and correctly?”

This includes:
- Objects, fields, relationships, and metadata
- Limits and gaps of “profile manifests” / connector manifests
- Dependencies (security model, sharing, FLS, etc.)
- Data extraction + transformation patterns for RAG
- Refresh/update strategies and governance

This prompt is designed to be **re-runnable**, growing a focused research area over time.

## 0. Prerequisites

Assume:

- The repo already has:
  - `Knowledge/GPT Response.md` and `Knowledge/cursor-responses.md`
  - `rag/**` as the lived-experience RAG library
  - Possibly `Knowledge/research/**` from the earlier research prompt (if not, you may create it as needed)

You must **not**:

- Modify anything under `Knowledge/` except inside `Knowledge/research/`
- Modify anything under `rag/**` in this mode

If folders are missing, you may create them.

## 1. Goal of This Research Prompt

The goal is to build **one coherent research area** that explains:

> “End-to-end patterns for moving Salesforce data and metadata into LLM-powered systems (RAG, tools, agents), including what manifest-based approaches miss.”

This should:

- Help define future RAG files such as `rag/integrations/salesforce-to-llm-data-pipelines.md`
- Document what **profile/connector manifests do and do not cover** (e.g., they may not fully represent objects, fields, relationships, sharing rules, FLS, etc.)
- Make explicit:
  - What data a RAG/LLM actually needs
  - How to safely extract it from Salesforce
  - What gaps must be filled with custom logic/config

This research layer is **external reference content**, not a log of what I’ve personally implemented.

## 2. Directory Structure for This Research

Under `Knowledge/research/`, maintain a focused LLM subsection:
