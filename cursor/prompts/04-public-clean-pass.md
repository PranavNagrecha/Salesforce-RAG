# Cursor – Public Release Clean Pass

You are my **Public-Release Cleaner** for this repo.

## Prerequisites

Before you run this prompt in Cursor, make sure:

- The RAG library under `rag/**` is in a reasonably stable state (you’ve already run the RAG refresh prompt).
- You are ready to prepare this repo for **public consumption** (e.g. pushing to GitHub).
- You understand that this pass is about **cleaning meta/boilerplate**, not changing technical content.

---

Goal:  
Before I push this repo publicly, scrub AI/meta/license junk from public-facing docs while preserving all real technical and architectural content.

This is a **lightweight cleanup pass** on top of an already-finished RAG library.

---

## 0. Scope (Files You MAY Edit)

You may read and modify:

- `README.md`
- `rag/**`
- `rag-index.md`
- `rag-library.json`
- `examples/**`
- Any explicit public-facing prompt like `cursor/prompts/Public RAG Command.md` **if it exists**
- Any other top-level `.md` docs intended to be public.

You must NOT touch:

- `Knowledge/**`
- `archive/**`
- `cursor/prompts/RAG Command .md` (internal builder prompt)
- `cursor/outputs/**`
- Any other clearly internal/private scratchpads.

## 1. Remove AI-Generation Boilerplate

Search in the allowed files for phrases like:

- “This document was generated by ChatGPT / GPT / an AI model…”
- “I am an AI and may be wrong…”
- “This README was created with GPT and might contain hallucinations…”

For each:

1. If it is pure meta/disclaimer text, **remove** it.
2. If some warning is genuinely useful, rewrite it generically, for example:
   - From: “This file was generated by GPT-4 and may contain errors.”
   - To:   “This documentation may contain mistakes; verify patterns before using in production.”

Keep **legitimate usage guidance** that mentions LLMs, e.g.:

- “You can use this repo with ChatGPT or another LLM-based assistant for RAG.”

Optionally generalize such usage lines to:

- “You can use this repo with ChatGPT or another LLM-based assistant for RAG.”  
  (i.e., don’t hide that it is meant to work with LLMs, just remove authoring boilerplate.)

---

## 2. Clean Placeholder License Text

Search for:

- “License: TBD”
- “add your license here”
- “choose any license you want here…”
- obvious template comments like:
  - `<!-- LICENSE: add your text here -->`

Rules:

1. If a section is clearly a **placeholder license block**, remove it entirely.
2. If there is a real `LICENSE` file with full text and the README simply states e.g.:
   - “License: MIT”  
   then leave that alone.
3. If license truly isn’t decided, you can normalize text to something neutral like:
   - “License: not yet specified by the repository owner.”

Do **not** invent a license.

---

## 3. Editing Boundaries

- Do **not** rewrite or simplify technical content, patterns, or examples.
- Only delete/alter:
  - meta AI-generation disclaimers, and
  - placeholder license boilerplate.

If a line mixes important technical content with boilerplate, carefully edit just the boilerplate part and keep the technical content intact.

---

## 4. Verification Pass

After your edits:

1. Re-scan the modified files for:
   - “generated by ChatGPT”
   - “generated by GPT”
   - “AI model”
   - “License: TBD”
   - “add your license”
2. Ensure any remaining references to “ChatGPT / GPT / LLM” are **only** in legitimate usage instructions, not in “this was generated by AI” disclaimers.

---

## 5. What to Report Back

In your chat response (not in the files), list:

- Each file you modified.
- For each file, briefly state what you cleaned:
  - e.g., “removed AI-generation disclaimer at top”, or
  - “deleted placeholder license section at bottom”.

Do **not** paste full file contents back into the chat; I will inspect the files directly in the editor.
