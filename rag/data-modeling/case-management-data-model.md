## Data Quality Patterns

### Field Description Quality

**Standards**:
- Good descriptions include: source, purpose, population, business rules
- Poor descriptions just repeat label
- Document field purpose and usage

### Help Text

**Pattern**: Add help text for user-facing fields

**Implementation**: Provide guidance to users on field purpose and expected values

### Picklist Conversions

**Pattern**: Convert Text fields with limited values to Picklists

**Implementation**: Improve data quality by using picklists for fields with limited valid values

## Multi-Tenant Data Isolation

### Record Type-Based Separation

- Use Record Types to distinguish between client, external partner, and internal records
- Apply Record Type-specific sharing rules and field-level security
- Route users to Record Type-appropriate landing pages

### Sharing Sets

- Implement Sharing Sets to enforce data visibility rules per user type
- Client users see only their own cases/records
- External partner users see only records for their associated organizations
- Internal staff can see cross-agency as needed according to policy

### Role Hierarchy

- Design role hierarchies that support cross-agency visibility for authorized staff
- Restricted access for portal users
- Organization-based access for external partner users

### Field-Level Security

- Use field-level security to protect sensitive PII at the field level
- Apply different field access based on user type
- Support compliance requirements

## Best Practices

### Case Object Design

- Use Cases as the primary record for ongoing service/benefits activity
- Link Cases to Contacts (clients) and Accounts (organizations)
- Include external system IDs for correlation with legacy systems
- Support multiple case types through Record Types
- Track case status and workflow stages explicitly

### Notice Object Modeling

- Create custom Notice objects to track outbound communications from external systems
- Include fields for Source/Template/Purpose codes owned by external system
- Link notices to Cases and Contacts for reporting
- Track notice delivery status and outcomes
- Support notice history and audit trails

### Transaction Object Modeling

- Create custom Transaction objects to track transactions logged by external engines
- Include transaction type, status, and outcome fields
- Link transactions to Cases and Notices
- Support transaction history and reporting
- Track transaction timestamps and external system correlation IDs

### External System Integration Fields

- Add fields to support external system integration
- External system IDs for correlation
- Last sync timestamp fields

## Q&A

### Q: What is a case management data model for public sector?

**A**: A **case management data model** for public sector supports multi-agency public benefits and services portals. It handles: (1) **Clients** (citizens/clients accessing services), (2) **External partner organizations** (service providers), (3) **Staff** (internal employees managing cases), (4) **Cases** (service requests, benefits applications), (5) **Notices and transactions** (from external systems). The model supports multiple user types with different identity providers and access patterns.

### Q: How do I separate different user types in a case management model?

**A**: Separate user types by: (1) **Record Types** on Account/Contact (client vs. external partner vs. internal staff), (2) **Different identity providers** (OIDC for clients, SAML for staff, organization tenant for partners), (3) **Sharing rules** (data visibility per user type), (4) **Portal experiences** (Experience Cloud for clients, internal Service Cloud for staff), (5) **Login handlers** (route users to appropriate experiences).

### Q: How do I model external partner organizations in case management?

**A**: Model external partners by: (1) **Separate Account Record Type** for external partners, (2) **Link to external partner staff** through Contact relationships, (3) **Support multiple partners per client** (client can have multiple service providers), (4) **External partner performance tracking** (track provider performance), (5) **Organization tenant identity** (external partner staff use organization tenant identity provider).

### Q: How do I handle cases in a multi-tenant case management model?

**A**: Handle cases by: (1) **Case object** for service requests and benefits applications, (2) **Link cases to clients** (Contact relationships), (3) **Link cases to external partners** (if applicable), (4) **Link cases to staff** (case assignment, ownership), (5) **Case sharing rules** (clients see their cases, partners see assigned cases, staff see based on sharing), (6) **Case status tracking** (track case progression).

### Q: How do I integrate with external benefits/eligibility systems?

**A**: Integrate by: (1) **External system IDs** (correlate Salesforce records with external systems), (2) **Notices object** (track notices from external systems), (3) **Transactions object** (track transactions from external systems), (4) **Integration jobs** (batch or real-time synchronization), (5) **Data reconciliation** (ensure data consistency). External IDs enable stable record mapping.

### Q: What is the difference between client Accounts and external partner Accounts?

**A**: **Client Accounts** represent individual citizens/clients (potentially person-style accounts for 1:1 Account-Contact relationships). **External partner Accounts** represent organizations providing services (separate Record Type, link to partner staff, support multiple partners per client). Use Record Types to differentiate and apply different sharing rules and access patterns.

### Q: How do I track notices and transactions from external systems?

**A**: Track by: (1) **Notices object** (track notices received from external systems), (2) **Transactions object** (track transactions from external systems), (3) **Link to Cases** (associate notices/transactions with cases), (4) **External system IDs** (correlate with external systems), (5) **Integration tracking** (track when notices/transactions were received). Notices and transactions provide audit trail and integration tracking.

### Q: How do I ensure data isolation between user types?

**A**: Ensure isolation by: (1) **Record Type-based separation** (different Record Types per user type), (2) **Sharing rules** (restrict data visibility per user type), (3) **Field-level security** (control field access per user type), (4) **Portal sharing** (Experience Cloud sharing for clients), (5) **Login handlers** (route users to appropriate experiences). Data isolation is critical for multi-tenant models.

### Q: When should I use this case management model?

**A**: Use when: (1) **Implementing public sector case management** (multi-agency, public benefits), (2) **Supporting multiple user types** (clients, external partners, staff), (3) **Integrating with external systems** (benefits/eligibility systems), (4) **Tracking notices and transactions** (from external systems), (5) **Requiring multi-tenant data isolation** (different access per user type).

### Q: What are best practices for case management data models?

**A**: Best practices include: (1) **Use Record Types** to separate user types, (2) **Implement sharing rules** for data isolation, (3) **Use external IDs** for integration, (4) **Track external system data** (notices, transactions), (5) **Support multiple identity providers** (OIDC, SAML, organization tenant), (6) **Design for scalability** (handle large case volumes), (7) **Maintain data quality** (validation, duplicate prevention).
