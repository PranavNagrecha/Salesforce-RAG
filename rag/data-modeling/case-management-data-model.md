## Q&A

### Q: What is a case management data model for public sector?

**A**: A **case management data model** for public sector supports multi-agency public benefits and services portals. It handles: (1) **Clients** (citizens/clients accessing services), (2) **External partner organizations** (service providers), (3) **Staff** (internal employees managing cases), (4) **Cases** (service requests, benefits applications), (5) **Notices and transactions** (from external systems). The model supports multiple user types with different identity providers and access patterns.

### Q: How do I separate different user types in a case management model?

**A**: Separate user types by: (1) **Record Types** on Account/Contact (client vs. external partner vs. internal staff), (2) **Different identity providers** (OIDC for clients, SAML for staff, organization tenant for partners), (3) **Sharing rules** (data visibility per user type), (4) **Portal experiences** (Experience Cloud for clients, internal Service Cloud for staff), (5) **Login handlers** (route users to appropriate experiences).

### Q: How do I model external partner organizations in case management?

**A**: Model external partners by: (1) **Separate Account Record Type** for external partners, (2) **Link to external partner staff** through Contact relationships, (3) **Support multiple partners per client** (client can have multiple service providers), (4) **External partner performance tracking** (track provider performance), (5) **Organization tenant identity** (external partner staff use organization tenant identity provider).

### Q: How do I handle cases in a multi-tenant case management model?

**A**: Handle cases by: (1) **Case object** for service requests and benefits applications, (2) **Link cases to clients** (Contact relationships), (3) **Link cases to external partners** (if applicable), (4) **Link cases to staff** (case assignment, ownership), (5) **Case sharing rules** (clients see their cases, partners see assigned cases, staff see based on sharing), (6) **Case status tracking** (track case progression).

### Q: How do I integrate with external benefits/eligibility systems?

**A**: Integrate by: (1) **External system IDs** (correlate Salesforce records with external systems), (2) **Notices object** (track notices from external systems), (3) **Transactions object** (track transactions from external systems), (4) **Integration jobs** (batch or real-time synchronization), (5) **Data reconciliation** (ensure data consistency). External IDs enable stable record mapping.

### Q: What is the difference between client Accounts and external partner Accounts?

**A**: **Client Accounts** represent individual citizens/clients (potentially person-style accounts for 1:1 Account-Contact relationships). **External partner Accounts** represent organizations providing services (separate Record Type, link to partner staff, support multiple partners per client). Use Record Types to differentiate and apply different sharing rules and access patterns.

### Q: How do I track notices and transactions from external systems?

**A**: Track by: (1) **Notices object** (track notices received from external systems), (2) **Transactions object** (track transactions from external systems), (3) **Link to Cases** (associate notices/transactions with cases), (4) **External system IDs** (correlate with external systems), (5) **Integration tracking** (track when notices/transactions were received). Notices and transactions provide audit trail and integration tracking.

### Q: How do I ensure data isolation between user types?

**A**: Ensure isolation by: (1) **Record Type-based separation** (different Record Types per user type), (2) **Sharing rules** (restrict data visibility per user type), (3) **Field-level security** (control field access per user type), (4) **Portal sharing** (Experience Cloud sharing for clients), (5) **Login handlers** (route users to appropriate experiences). Data isolation is critical for multi-tenant models.

### Q: When should I use this case management model?

**A**: Use when: (1) **Implementing public sector case management** (multi-agency, public benefits), (2) **Supporting multiple user types** (clients, external partners, staff), (3) **Integrating with external systems** (benefits/eligibility systems), (4) **Tracking notices and transactions** (from external systems), (5) **Requiring multi-tenant data isolation** (different access per user type).

### Q: What are best practices for case management data models?

**A**: Best practices include: (1) **Use Record Types** to separate user types, (2) **Implement sharing rules** for data isolation, (3) **Use external IDs** for integration, (4) **Track external system data** (notices, transactions), (5) **Support multiple identity providers** (OIDC, SAML, organization tenant), (6) **Design for scalability** (handle large case volumes), (7) **Maintain data quality** (validation, duplicate prevention).

## Edge Cases and Limitations

### Edge Case 1: Multi-Tenant Data Isolation Verification

**Scenario**: Verifying that data isolation between user types (clients, external partners, staff) is working correctly.

**Consideration**:
- Test data access from each user type perspective (clients, partners, staff)
- Verify Record Type-based separation is enforced
- Test sharing rules and sharing sets for each user type
- Monitor for cross-community data access issues
- Implement audit trails to track data access by user type

### Edge Case 2: High-Volume Case Creation

**Consideration**:
- Limit relationship depth when querying cases
- Use pagination for related record queries
- Consider data archiving for historical cases
- Monitor case-related record performance
- Test case queries with large related record sets

### Edge Case 4: External System Integration Failures

**Scenario**: Integration failures with external benefits/eligibility systems, causing data inconsistency.

**Consideration**:
- Implement retry logic for transient integration failures

- Track integration job status and errors
- Implement data reconciliation processes
- Support manual data correction and reprocessing

### Edge Case 5: Notice and Transaction Volume

**Scenario**: High-volume notices and transactions from external systems, creating large data volumes.

**Consideration**:
- Use Bulk API for high-volume notice/transaction imports
- Implement data archiving for historical notices/transactions
- Monitor notice/transaction table size and performance
- Consider batch processing for notice/transaction creation
- Test notice/transaction processing with production-like volumes

### Limitations

- **Record Type Limits**: Maximum 200 record types per object (may limit user type separation)
- **Sharing Rule Limits**: Maximum 300 sharing rules per object (varies by org edition)
- **Sharing Set Limits**: Maximum 50 Sharing Sets per Experience Cloud site
- **Case Relationship Limits**: Cases have relationship limits (lookups, master-detail)
- **External System Integration**: Integration complexity and error handling requirements
- **Data Isolation Verification**: Difficult to verify complete data isolation between user types
